# window.fetch polyfill

The `fetch()` function is a Promise-based mechanism for programmatically making
web requests in the browser. This project is a polyfill that implements a subset
of the standard [Fetch specification][], enough to make `fetch` a viable
replacement for most uses of XMLHttpRequest in traditional web applications.

This project adheres to the [Open Code of Conduct][]. By participating, you are
expected to uphold this code.

## Read this first

* If you believe you found a bug with how `fetch` behaves in Chrome or Firefox,
  please **don't open an issue in this repository**. This project is a
  _polyfill_, and since Chrome and Firefox both implement the `window.fetch`
  function natively, no code from this project actually takes any effect in
  these browsers. See [Browser support](#browser-support) for detailed
  information.

* If you have trouble **making a request to another domain** (a different
  subdomain or port number also constitutes another domain), please familiarize
  yourself with all the intricacies and limitations of [CORS][] requests.
  Because CORS requires participation of the server by implementing specific
  HTTP response headers, it is often nontrivial to set up or debug. CORS is
  exclusively handled by the browser's internal mechanisms which this polyfill
  cannot influence.

* If you have trouble **maintaining the user's session** or [CSRF][] protection
  through `fetch` requests, please ensure that you've read and understood the
  [Sending cookies](#sending-cookies) section. `fetch` doesn't send cookies
  unless you ask it to.

* This project **doesn't work under Node.js environments**. It's meant for web
  browsers only. You should ensure that your application doesn't try to package
  and run this on the server.

* If you have an idea for a new feature of `fetch`, **submit your feature
  requests** to the [specification's repository](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues).
  We only add features and APIs that are part of the [Fetch specification][].

## Installation

* `npm install whatwg-fetch --save`; or

* `bower install fetch`; or

* `yarn add whatwg-fetch`.

You will also need a Promise polyfill for [older browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises).
We recommend [taylorhakes/promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill)
for its small size and Promises/A+ compatibility.

For use with webpack, add this package in the `entry` configuration option
before your application entry point:

```javascript
entry: ['whatwg-fetch', ...]
```

For Babel and ES2015+, make sure to import the file:

```javascript
import 'whatwg-fetch'
```

## Usage

### HTML

```javascript
fetch('/users.html')
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.text()
  }).then(function(body) {
    document.body.innerHTML = body
  })
```

### JSON

```javascript
fetch('/users.json')
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json()
  }).then(function(json) {
    console.log('parsed json', json)
  }).catch(function(ex) {
    console.log('parsing failed', ex)
  })
```

### Response metadata

```javascript
fetch('/users.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log(response.headers.get('Content-Type'))
  console.log(response.headers.get('Date'))
  console.log(response.status)
  console.log(response.statusText)
})
```

### Post form

```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('form')

fetch('/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: new FormData(form)
})
```

### Post JSON

```javascript
fetch('/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Hubot',
    login: 'hubot',
  })
})
```

### File upload

```javascript
var input = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]')

var data = new FormData()
data.append('file', input.files[0])
data.append('user', 'hubot')

fetch('/avatars', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: data
})
```

### Caveats

The `fetch` specification differs
